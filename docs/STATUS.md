# Project Status

## Current phase

**V1/MVP is complete; V2 roadmap is now active.**

- V1 completion remains **100% (13/13 phases complete)**.
- V2 completion remains **0% (0/8 phases complete)** until an entire V2 phase meets acceptance.
- Active V2 phase: **V2-1 Advanced Creator Timeline**.

V1 roadmap:
- M0–M8 MVP: 9/9 complete.
- P1 Safe real-provider boundary: complete.
- P2 Async remote AI transport: complete.
- P3 Production AI provider/backend integration: complete.
- P4 Image → skill proposal → Creator → Training production flow: complete.

V2 roadmap is defined in `docs/V2_ROADMAP.md` and captures previously discussed/deferred capabilities outside the V1 acceptance boundary.

## V2 roadmap

1. V2-1 Advanced Creator Timeline — **in progress**.
2. V2-2 Extended Skill Families — pending.
3. V2-3 Character Animation & Audio Authoring — pending.
4. V2-4 AI Opponents & Single-player Gameplay — pending.
5. V2-5 Game Modes, Balance & Competitive Foundation — pending.
6. V2-6 Network PvP — pending.
7. V2-7 Creator Sharing Ecosystem — pending.
8. V2-8 Mobile Targets — pending.

V2-1 includes visual event timeline authoring, startup/active/recovery timing, animation/VFX/audio events, hitbox/hurtbox timing and spatial editing, safe multi-event compositions, validation, and Creator → Training preview.

### V2-1 implementation checkpoint

The first V2-1 work unit is synchronized on branch `feat/v2-1-timeline-schema`:
- `SkillDefinition` accepts an optional backwards-compatible `timeline` object while existing V1 skill JSON remains valid without one.
- Timeline schema version 1 supports safe declarative `animation`, `vfx`, `audio`, `hitbox`, and `hurtbox` event types.
- Events have stable IDs, non-negative time/duration, deterministic non-decreasing order, duplicate-ID rejection, a 64-event limit, and a 30-second safety limit.
- Arbitrary event types/code are rejected.
- `has_timeline()` and `total_timeline_duration()` expose the parsed timeline without changing the existing V1 cast-state timing path yet.
- `tests/skill_timeline_test_runner.gd` covers V1 compatibility, valid multi-event timelines, ordering, duplicate IDs, unsupported event types and timeline schema versions.
- The existing CI domain-test stage now runs the timeline test runner.

Formal GitHub CI validation for this branch is the next gate; this checkpoint is not yet a completed V2-1 phase.

## V1 production acceptance checkpoint

P3 was accepted on 2026-09-16. Production Free Gemini E2E Run #4 (`35061328085`) passed real text and reference-PNG requests on exact revision `c5d36b7c9d6f7befa506d70798b0d00fef526e4e`, with Gemini 3.6 Flash, Free Tier guards, trusted Render credential isolation, structured VFX/skill output and deterministic Sharp PNG rendering.

P4 was accepted on 2026-09-16. Production Free Gemini E2E Run #5 (`35075099182`) completed successfully on exact revision `a572b0a3e60e377ae9152592c6d8c62e574a8554` and emitted `PRODUCTION_CREATOR_GEMINI_E2E_PASSED provider=gemini revision=a572b0a3e60e377ae9152592c6d8c62e574a8554 reference=true proposal=true confirmPreview=true cast=true damage=18`.

The V1 completion documentation was merged by PR #131; the V1 completion checkpoint on `main` is `ff744f643b37cc1947225ef4dbe052108d739a66`.

V2 roadmap activation PR #132 was merged to `main` at `41c047029175e4b1409fcd2f49e023332e5663e7`; Main CI #285 (`35084613478`) completed successfully, including Chromium, Windows Native, Microsoft Edge, Pages deployment, production public-Web checks, Render exact-revision readiness and production Edge smoke.

## Validation policy

Validation is **100% online-only**. Formal project validation uses GitHub-hosted Godot/domain/backend tests, Web export, Chromium, GitHub-hosted Microsoft Edge, GitHub Pages, Render exact-revision readiness, production Edge smoke, and manual real Gemini E2E only when real provider quota is required.

Do not use Remote Desktop Commander, the user's local machine, local Godot/npm/browser caches, or user-device storage for formal project validation or Git synchronization.

## Execution policy

Continue through all non-blocked implementation, regression, cloud validation, fixes, merge and documentation work for the active phase. Do not stop at a completed sub-job. If a required validation fails, inspect online evidence, fix it when permitted, and follow the replacement run through terminal state.

Every reported completed code/test/doc/config work unit must already be synchronized to GitHub. Unsynchronized work cannot be counted as Done.

V1 stays 100%. V2 progress is independent and advances only when V2 phase acceptance criteria are met and synchronized.

## Next implementation target

Open and validate the first V2-1 timeline-schema PR. After that schema is stable, connect timeline data to Creator Skill Draft/Editor authoring and then to runtime event execution while preserving the V1 fallback path.
